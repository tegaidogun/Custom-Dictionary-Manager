<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The program is developed using Java and revolves around the concept of a custom-linked list. It comprises classes to hold word meanings, create nodes for the linked list, manage the linked list, and a main class to test the functionalities. The program outputs two scrollable lists: the current list of words with their meanings and a list of deleted words.</p>
